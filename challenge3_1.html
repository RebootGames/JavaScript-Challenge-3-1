		This challenge contiues to build on everything done so far AND the work you completed last tutorial.
		Some of the tasks you are expected to do will challenge your understanding of programming skills and appreciation of this programs logic; please dont 'cheat' (that doesn't mean dont ask friends, tutors etc, it means please take the time to understand how and what is happening.  

		Things to start considering
			Hopefully by now, and certainly by the end of this tutorial you will start seeing a degree of code duplication - although each block may not be exactly the same (e.g. line 276 - 300 and 325 - 355 and 375 - 418) there is definite pattern; consider what sort of function you could create to help reduce and remove this type of duplication (remember input-process-output; what info does it need, how does it use it, what is the output)

		Tasks:
			1. Get this program running in Chrome and test it; don't forget to enable to console to view debug messages
			2. Review the challenge3_1 flowchart against any previous versions (if you didn't finish your flowchart use this version to help become more familiar with the game's general logic)
			3. Review the changes implemented in this release against any you programmed based on the previous task lists
			4. Expand the code to make each of the three enemies (green, purple & red) move at different speeds; this could be easily done my modifing the distance they travel during each loop
			5. Try to create a more varied pattern with the ememies - an easy way might be to set their initial positions to a more wide spread pattern; e.g. some higher, some lower
			6. This tutorial includes a few new features, a moving sky and the addition of a cloud, expand the/your code so the cloud moves at reasonable pace left (towards the red plane)
			7. Expand you cloud moving feature so that once the cloud is off-screen it wraps back around - but appears on a random (see your work on tutorial 1 for sample code) y position (the random y position should be limited so that the cloud is on-screen (height-wise); e.g. y should be between 0 and the height of the cloud minus the height of the canvas)
			8. We have included a global variable (bBullet) used to either draw the bullet or hide the bullet; update the animation loop so that if the bBullet == true the graphic is drawn, if false the grahic is not drawn; test your code by simply changing the variable's initial value (true/false)
			9. Expand you code so that when the user releases the 'space' key the bullet is show at a location just infront of the plane's gun (just below the wing and slightly off-centre), the bullet should not move up or down with the plane once it is being drawn; the default state of the variable controlling whether the bullet is shown (bBullet) should be false so that the bullet is only drawn after the player releases 'space'
			10. Improve your code so that each of the enemies (green, purple and red) are located at the following distances (approx.) from the left edge of the canvas: 33%, 50% and 66%; use the width of the canvas to calulate each of the ememies x positions
			11. Improve your code so that you include a second version of the sky (e.g. imgPic[7]), this instance should use the same details as the original sky (imgPic[0]) expect that its x starting position is the width of the original sky image + 1; this means it should sit directly next to the first and provide a seemless transition
			12. Improve your code so that the imgPic[7] (second sky) graphic travels as the same speed and in the same direction as imgPic[0] - this should allow you to fly seemlessly off the end of the orginal sky and on to the start of the new sky; this doubles the width of the sky before going off-screen
			13. Expand your code so that you can fly endlessly; e.g. no break in the sky graphics - things to consider: once the imgPic[0] is off-screen (using almost the exact code used to wrap the ememies and plane) it's x position is reset to the imgPic[7].x + imgPic[7].width + 1 (you may need to play around with this to get the best fit)

		Quick Check
			By the end of this tutorial you should have: 
			an endless sky scrolling left
			three enemies moving in a variety of speeds and at dynamic (calculated) x positions
			at least one cloud moving in the background; dont forget you you add a few different clouds moving at different speeds to create an even more engaging environment
			a bullet showing up in the correct position when the player releases 'space'

		Prep for the next tutorial
			All the features listed above will be implemented so you can compare, check and reflect on your work
			Firing the bullet 
			Checking for a collision with an enemy
